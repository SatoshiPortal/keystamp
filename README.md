# keystamp-utility
A desktop application allowing users to sign and verify PGP messages and to create and validate timestamp proofs with the OpenTimestamps protocol, using the Bitcoin blockchain as a timestamp notary. Built with Meteor, Electron, opentimestamp-javascript and openpgpjs. It is using the official opentimestamp-client library written by Peter Todd, using the javascript implementation of Ricardo Cassetta. This tool is being developped as part of Satoshi Portal's "Keystamp" proof creation and verification process. It can be used to verify and validate invoices, receipts and agreements from bylls.com and bitcoinoutlet.com
